For correlation:
Feature "fractal_dim_mean" is most sensitive to cancer for "pearson" method.
Feature "concave_pts_se" is most sensitive to cancer for "kendall" method.

For standard scaler:
All four algorithms (DT, RF, KNN, SVC) has differences in their average accuracy output between unscaled and scaled methods.
From the data, DT and RF is barely affected by scaling or not, but scaling has a significant effect on KNN and SVC.

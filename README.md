|  1  | ML_w2_BasicProgStructure.ipynb    | Original Decision Tree algorithm demonstration in Jupyter Notebook.                                                                     |
|  2  | ML_w2_DecisionTree_basic.py       | Perform single time of Decision Tree training and testing from tumor cell data.                                                         |
|  3  | ML_w2_DecisionTree_consistency.py | Perform multiple times of Decision Tree training and testing from tumor cell data in order to test Decision Tree algorithm consistency. |
|  4  | BD_w3_OWID_COVID19_class.ipynb    | Code follows teacher's video instruction.                                                                                               |
|  5  | BD_w3_OWID_COVID19_hw.ipynb       | BD w3 Homework.                                                                                                                         |

## Optional Code ideas

1. ML_w2_DecisionTree_DevelopmentTrend.py : use the data gathered while looping the algorithm and display as bar chart or line graph.
2. ML_w3_MultiModelComparison.py : compare different models mentione in class.
3. ML_w3_StdScalerPerformance.py : compare the difference with and without using scaler.
